      "fact": "A niche is a specialized segment of a market with specific needs. Niche strategies focus on serving a narrow segment exceptionally well rather than competing broadly. Benefits include reduced competition, stronger customer relationships, and clearer positioning. Successful niche players often expand to adjacent segments after establishing dominance in their core market."

      "fact": "The target market is the specific group of customers a product aims to serve. Defining your target involves demographics, psychographics, behaviors, and needs. Clear targeting focuses resources, sharpens messaging, and improves product-market fit. Trying to serve everyone often means serving no one well. Successful products start with a specific target and expand deliberately."

      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "Market demand represents the total quantity of a product or service that customers are willing and able to purchase. Understanding demand involves analyzing customer needs, purchasing power, preferences, and market size. Product managers must assess whether sufficient demand exists, how to capture it, and how demand might evolve with market changes or competitive actions."

      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "Supply refers to the availability of a product or service in the market. In digital products, supply considerations include capacity, scalability, and operational constraints. In marketplaces, balancing supply and demand is crucial. Understanding supply dynamics helps product managers plan resources, set realistic expectations, and identify bottlenecks that could limit growth."

      "fact": "A market sector is a broad category of businesses or customers with similar characteristics. Common sectors include healthcare, finance, education, retail, and manufacturing. Sector knowledge helps product managers understand specific regulations, purchasing processes, decision-makers, and success factors. Many B2B products specialize in serving particular sectors effectively."

      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "A vertical market serves a specific industry with specialized needs. Vertical products are deeply tailored to industry requirements, workflows, and regulations. While smaller than horizontal markets, verticals allow deep specialization, command premium pricing, and face less direct competition. Vertical strategy requires deep domain expertise and strong customer relationships within the industry."
