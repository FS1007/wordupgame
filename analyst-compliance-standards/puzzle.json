    {"word": "PRIVACY", "fragments": ["PRIV", "ACY"], "orientation": "vertical", "fact": "<strong>Privacy:</strong> Protection of personal data under regulations like GDPR (EU), CCPA (California), and various data protection laws. Privacy principles include consent, purpose limitation, data minimization, and right to deletion. Organizations must document data flows and implement privacy-by-design."},
    {"word": "HEALTH", "fragments": ["HEA", "LTH"], "orientation": "vertical", "fact": "<strong>Health:</strong> Healthcare data protected by HIPAA (US), requiring administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protected health information (PHI). Covered entities and business associates must implement encryption, access controls, audit logging, and breach notification procedures."},
    {"word": "FINANCE", "fragments": ["FIN", "ANCE"], "orientation": "vertical", "fact": "<strong>Finance:</strong> Financial data governed by PCI-DSS for payment cards, SOX for public companies, and banking regulations. Financial institutions implement strong authentication, encryption at rest and in transit, network segmentation, and comprehensive audit trails to protect sensitive financial information."},
    {"word": "AUDIT", "fragments": ["AUD", "IT"], "orientation": "vertical", "fact": "<strong>Audit:</strong> Independent examination of systems, processes, and controls. SOC 2 audits verify security, availability, confidentiality, processing integrity, and privacy controls. ISO 27001 certification requires systematic audit of information security management systems. Regular audits identify gaps and ensure compliance."},
    {"word": "POLICY", "fragments": ["POL", "ICY"], "orientation": "vertical", "fact": "<strong>Policy:</strong> Formal rules governing security practices—acceptable use, password requirements, data classification, incident response. Policies must be documented, communicated, and enforced. Regular policy reviews ensure alignment with current threats and business needs. Security awareness training reinforces policy compliance."},
    {"word": "CONTROL", "fragments": ["CONT", "ROL"], "orientation": "vertical", "fact": "<strong>Control:</strong> Security measures implementing policy requirements—access controls, encryption, logging, change management. NIST Cybersecurity Framework and CIS Controls provide control baselines. Controls are preventive, detective, or corrective. Control effectiveness validated through testing and continuous monitoring."}
