      "fact": "The concept stage is where product ideas are generated and initially evaluated. Teams assess market need, competitive landscape, technical feasibility, and business opportunity. This stage involves rapid learning through customer research and prototyping. Most concepts don't progress, making it crucial to fail fast on bad ideas and invest in promising ones."

      "fact": "Development is when the product is built based on validated concepts. This involves detailed design, engineering, testing, and iteration. Product managers balance speed with quality, manage scope, and ensure the team builds the right thing.

      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "Launch introduces the product to the market. Successful launches coordinate product readiness, go-to-market strategy, marketing campaigns, sales enablement, and customer support. The first customers provide critical feedback. Product managers must be ready to respond quickly to issues and opportunities revealed after launch."

      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "Mature products have established market position and stable user bases. Growth slows, competition intensifies, and margins face pressure. Product strategy shifts toward efficiency, incremental improvements, and defending market share. Mature products fund innovation in newer offerings while still serving core customers effectively."

      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "Decline occurs when products lose relevance due to new technologies, changing needs, or superior alternatives. Product managers must decide whether to revitalize, maintain, or retire products. Resources should shift to growing products, but decline must be managed carefully to protect customer relationships and brand reputation."
