      "word": "FLEXION",
      "fragments": ["FLE", "XION"],
      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "Flexion is a bending movement that decreases the angle at a joint. Why it matters: it enables actions like sitting or lifting. Today's takeaway: flexion helps the body fold and move inward."

      "word": "EXTENSION",
      "fragments": ["EX", "TEN", "SION"],
      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "Extension straightens a joint and increases the angle between bones. Why it matters: it supports standing and reaching. Today's takeaway: extension helps the body return to an upright position."

      "word": "ROTATION",
      "fragments": ["RO", "TA", "TION"],
      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "Rotation is a twisting movement around an axis. Why it matters: it allows turning motions of the neck and trunk. Today's takeaway: rotation enables controlled directional movement."

      "word": "PRONATION",
      "fragments": ["PRON", "AT", "ION"],
      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "Pronation involves turning a limb so the palm or foot faces downward. Why it matters: it supports grip and walking mechanics. Today's takeaway: pronation helps absorb force during movement."

      "word": "LATERAL",
      "fragments": ["LA", "TER", "AL"],
      "orientation": "vertical",
      "fact": "Lateral movement shifts the body or limb sideways. Why it matters: it improves balance and stability. Today's takeaway: lateral control supports safe and coordinated motion."
